// Shield counts for Super Mega Raid bosses, keyed by Pokemon name without the "Mega" prefix (every
// entry here is a Mega Evolution by definition). Only Mega-Evolved Pokemon can break these shields
// (one per Trainer), unlike standard raid shields. Counts confirmed via Pokemon GO Hub raid guides;
// bosses not listed here simply render without a shield badge until confirmed and added.
